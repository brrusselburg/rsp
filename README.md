RSP came from having to check multiple spots (email, LinkedIn, etc) to see if I had already applied to a job.

In order to spare recruiters from duplicate apps and my own pride from my short-term memory, I'm making this little app to keep track.

TODO: *seinfeld voice* what's the deal with that search icon? maybe find another
TODO: add field on Company table for "contact" to keep track of folks who want me to keep in touch
TODO: goofy pop-up or animation that pops up when you apply to 10 in a day, 5 in an hour, etc.
TODO: add flag reminder to follow-up (probably on the Job table)
TODO: make job states fixed options instead of strings a la 'interviewing', 'nope', 'no-response abyss'
TODO: add a flag on Company to indicate how well their stack fits my experience
TODO: hookup search bar to use elasticsearch
TODO: add some tests
TODO: add separate field for 'date_applied' so that the todo below will work
TODO: add CSV import feature (cols: job title, company name, date applied)
