RSP came from having to check multiple spots (email, LinkedIn, etc) to see if I had already applied to a job.

In order to spare recruiters from duplicate apps and my own pride from my short-term memory, I'm making this little app to keep track.

TODO: make prettier
TODO: add job states - 'interviewing', 'nope', 'no-response abyss'
TODO: add a counter situation that can either be queried via CLI or shows up on the page, shows # of jobs you've applied to per company
TODO: add a similar ^^ command (etc) to query for the date of your last application to that company
TODO: add a job source field (string; "LinkedIn" for ex.)
