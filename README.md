RSP came from having to check multiple spots (email, LinkedIn, etc) to see if I had already applied to a job.

In order to spare recruiters from duplicate apps and my own pride from my short-term memory, I'm making this little app to keep track.

TODO: make prettier
TODO: hook up new dashboard to counters that show how many jobs I've applied to that day / week / etc (for sanity purposes)
TODO: make job states fixed options instead of strings a la 'interviewing', 'nope', 'no-response abyss'
TODO: add a flag on Company to indicate how well their stack fits my experience
TODO: add searchbar to the application layout and hook it up to search jobs OR companies
